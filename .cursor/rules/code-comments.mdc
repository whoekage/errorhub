# Code Commenting Guidelines

## Language

- All code comments must be written in English only
- Use clear, concise language
- Avoid slang, jargon, or region-specific idioms

## When to Comment

- Comment complex algorithms or business logic
- Document public APIs and exported functions
- Explain non-obvious workarounds or edge cases
- Provide context for important decisions

## Comment Format

- Use JSDoc style comments for functions and classes
- Keep inline comments brief
- Use TODO, FIXME, and NOTE prefixes when appropriate
- For multi-line comments, maintain consistent indentation

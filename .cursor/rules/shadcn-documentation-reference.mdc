# Shadcn/UI Documentation Reference

When performing frontend development tasks, especially those involving UI components, always consult the official [shadcn/ui documentation](https://ui.shadcn.com/docs).

This includes:
- Checking for available components.
- Verifying correct installation and usage patterns (e.g., `npx shadcn@latest add [component]`).
- Understanding component props and styling conventions (Tailwind CSS).

Adhering to shadcn/ui patterns ensures consistency and leverages the chosen design system effectively.

# ErrorHub Project Overview

ErrorHub is a centralized error management system with message localization. The system allows developers to use error codes instead of text messages in code, while dynamically retrieving user-facing messages by code and required locale through API.

## Project Structure

This monorepo is organized using npm workspaces and includes the following packages:


- [packages/sdk](mdc:packages/sdk) - SDK for working with the error API
- [packages/api](mdc:packages/api) - REST API server
- [packages/admin-ui](mdc:packages/admin-ui) - administrative interface
- [packages/shared-ui](mdc:packages/shared-ui) - shared UI components

## Code Style Guidelines

- Only write comments in English
- Use consistent naming conventions
- Follow TypeScript best practices
- Use Prettier and ESLint for code formatting and linting
